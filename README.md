## Kaggle machine learning chalenges

In this repository, I collect files trying to address some kaggle chalenges.

So far I have the following files:

- --Titanic survivors--: Trying to predict the survivors (0: dead, 1: survive) of the Titanic disaster, based on info about the passengers (like age, number of relatives, class on board, origin, ...).  Simple classification models give reasonable predictions.

- Don't overfit 2: An artificial dataset with only 250 training data, each with 300 features, with target binaries. Easy to overfit. I try many simple sklearn classification models. I also try some feature reduction models and bayesian models.
